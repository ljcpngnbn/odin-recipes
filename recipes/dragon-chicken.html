            </ul>

        <h2>Batter</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tbsp plain all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 tbsp rice flour</li>
                <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
                <li>1 tsp Kashmiri chili powder</li>
                <li>2 garlic cloves, grated</li>
                <li>1 tsp ginger, finely grated</li>
                <li>1 egg white</li>
                <li>2 tsp soy sauce</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Combine ingredients for the stir fry sauce in a bowl. Give evrything a good mix to combine, then set aside later.</p></li>
                <li><p>To make the batter, whick together the plain flour, rice flour, baking powder and salt in a large mixing bowl. Add in the chili powder, garlic, ginger, egg white, soy sauce and 100ml of water. Mix to combine well. Now add the chicken pieces and ensure they're all well coated.</p></li>
                <li><p>Fill a wok or large saucepan with vegetable oil one-third of the way up. Turn onto medium-high heat. The oil is hot when a wooden chopstick or the end of a wooden spoon will bubble when placed in the oil - total Asian mum trick! Working in batches, carefully remove the chicken pieces from the batter and lower into the hot oil. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until golden brown and crispy. Transfer to a cooling rack set over paper towel to drain. Repeat with the remaining chicken.</p></li>
                <li><p>Place a clean wok over high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil then add the onion and stir-fry for half a minute. Then add the capsicum and cashews and stir-fry for a minute. Now add the dried chilies and stir-fry for another half a minute. Add the chicken, stir-fry sauce, fresh red chili and spring onion.Toss until well combined. Serve with steamed rice, if using.</p></li>
